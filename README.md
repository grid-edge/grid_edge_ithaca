# GrRIDS — ResStock + AMI Load Analysis 

This repository contains the full data pipeline for the GRIDs project. It downloads and runs NLR ResStock building energy models for upstate New York, processes AMI (smart meter) interval data, matches simulated loads to metered buildings, aggregates both datasets to distribution feeder nodes, and evaluates model accuracy against measured AMI loads.

---

# Project Context

The goal is to build feeder-level load profiles for the Dryden, NY distribution circuit by combining:

- **ResStock** — NLR's national residential building stock model used to simulate 15-minute electricity load profiles for representative buildings
- **AMI** — 15-minute interval smart meter data for ~792 service points on the circuit
- **OpenDSS feeder model** — transformer-level network topology used to map meters and buildings to feeder nodes

The matched, aggregated load profiles feed into downstream optimization work to study demand flexibility and grid edge resources.

# Workflow Run Order

Run notebooks in the following order.

## Step 1 — Download and Run ResStock Models

### `download_resstock_models_latest-Resstock2025.ipynb`

Downloads ResStock models from S3, runs OpenStudio simulations, and saves timeseries Parquet outputs.

### Outputs

- `data/parquet/resstock_timeseries_all_15.parquet`
- `data/parquet/ami_ind_data_15.parquet`
- `data/base_files/building_ids_metadata_2025.csv`

---

## Step 2 — AMI ↔ ResStock Matching

### External Repository

`buildstock-ami-mapping`

Run separately to match each AMI meter to its best-fit ResStock building.

### Output

- `results/match_report.csv`

---

## Step 3 — Aggregate to Feeder Nodes

### `Aggregate AMI and Resstock Load to Feeder Node.ipynb`

Reads AMI + match report and aggregates both datasets to transformer-level feeder nodes.

### Outputs

- `results/aggregated_load_nodes_wide_ami.csv`
- `results/aggregated_load_nodes_wide_resstock_RES_ONLY.csv`

---

## Step 4 — Compare ResStock vs AMI

### `Aggregate ResStock and AMI to Feeder Node_02022026-Copy1.ipynb`

Compares simulated ResStock loads against measured AMI loads by feeder branch.

### Outputs

- `notebooks/figures_resstock_vs_ami/`

---

# Key Caveats

## Leap Year Handling

ResStock TMY3 release 2 models are **not leap-year aware**.

Use:

- simulation run period = **2023**
- weather file = **2024 EPW**

Remove **Feb 29** from AMI before comparison.

---

## S3 Source

```bash
s3://oedi-data-lake/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2025/
```

---

## County Scope

Counties included:

- Tompkins
- Cortland
- Tioga
- Chemung
- Schuyler
- Seneca
- Cayuga

Coverage:

- 607 buildings (2024 dataset)
- 1,516 buildings (2025 dataset)

---

## AMI Coverage

- 792 total SPIDs
- 154 commercial SPIDs
- 33 residential SPIDs unmatched in match report

Unmatched residential SPIDs fall back to AMI in aggregation.

---

## Timeseries Length

All timeseries are filtered to:

- **35,040 timestamps**
- `365 days × 96 intervals`
- Feb 29 excluded
